# Workshop-9


## video killed the radio star (1/2/25)
- started watching Leo's guide which was fun, I want to add some distortion i think
- it seems like Leo is combining the simulation techniques seen in workshop 7 so I thought I might as well add my work from that workshop onto this one
- my design is to used four different webcam squares to make a cool art piece, if I have the time maybe try to make them all confined to specific quadrants possibly
- I asked DeepSeek if it is capable of combining both pieces and this is it's reply:

## final video work plus sharpening some aspects
- DeepSeek tidied up a lot of my work which was really good for me to see what was consequential and what caused some problems e.g. creating more webcam squares than I wanted, here is some of the coding advice it gave that helped tidy up my work:

## 780 was the amount of nippers i was able to add in total and I think it looks awesome
- I mess around more with sizes and function of my nipper army and ended up with something I'm super proud of and will definatelty come back to edit and play with again
